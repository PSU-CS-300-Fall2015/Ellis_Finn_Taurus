[Fri Dec  4 11:29:23 2015] natreed: You online to test?
[Fri Dec  4 11:33:56 2015] relsqui: Am now! Between working. :) How's it going?
[Fri Dec  4 11:34:54 2015] natreed: Cool. I'm glad this went through.  Does my header look OK?
[Fri Dec  4 11:37:40 2015] relsqui: Apparently! My implementation is parsing it just fine. (I don't store the raw, just some reformatted output.)
[Fri Dec  4 11:38:44 2015] natreed: Great! This concludes my test.  Thank you.
[Fri Dec  4 11:39:06 2015] relsqui: np, have a great day! good luck with finals!
[Fri Dec  4 11:39:27 2015] natreed: Thanks.  You too!

[Fri Dec  4 12:13:23 2015] relsqui: Sending works, receiving should work too if the ddns has updated to the IP you're actually sending from.
