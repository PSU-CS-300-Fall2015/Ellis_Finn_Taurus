[Fri Dec  4 00:47:37 2015] relsqui: No problem. I find that most people I test aren't listening at the moment, hehe. Luckily the echo server is a thing! Nice auto-timestamps, by the way. They're redundant in my logs but a cool feature.
[Fri Dec  4 00:48:10 2015] chupacabra: yeah the time stamp is redundant in mine as well. I tag outgoing and incoming messages.

[Fri Dec  4 00:48:40 2015] relsqui: Man my UI is really shitty for this right now lol, I have to type in your name every time. :) One thing at a time though.
[Fri Dec  4 00:49:25 2015] chupacabra: mine is the same way...after each message I type in the recipient again. good thing I put in a flag to display the address book haha

[Fri Dec  4 00:50:06 2015] relsqui: Yeah, I have grand plans of course, but ... MVP MVP MVP. :) I'm trying to keep in mind that the bulk of my project time this weekend is going to be the writeups, not the code.
[Fri Dec  4 00:51:02 2015] chupacabra: same here. I have a final tomorrow (or saturday but would rather just get it over with), and then I want the writeups done tomorrow so I can focus on 311 final for monday
